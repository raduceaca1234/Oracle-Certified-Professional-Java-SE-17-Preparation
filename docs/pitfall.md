# Pitfalls and Tips
## Watch out
- **case** is a reserved keyword in Java
- mind the **IOException** when you use try with resources
- Mind the type used in lambda, there ain't auto boxing. 

## I/O
- mind the checked exception within lambda, example: `toRealPath()`
- mark, check if the stream supports mark: `inputStream.markSupported()`
- What I/O classes to use? Reader/Writer for text, Stream for primitives and String values
- Check if the `System.out` or `System.err` is closed within the try-with-resource
- `relativize() `needs both Path to be either absolute or relative
- it's `System.console()` NOT ~~new Console()~~


## Localization
- there ain't ~~DateFormatter~~ only `DateTimeFormatter`

## Concurrency
- the Concurrent classes order read/write access such that access to the class is consistent 
across all threads and processes, while the synchronized classes do not. 
- `Future.get()` throws  `InterruptedException` and a  `ExecutionException`, and they block execution !!!!!!
- scheduled methods: `newScheduledThreadPool(10)`/`newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()`
- when the method is `synchronized`, check if it's static or instance

## Stream
-  `IntSummaryStatistics`, not ~~IntegerSummaryStatistics~~. 
- Do not confuse `IntStream` with `Stream<Integer>`
- `Stream.concat(s1, s2)` works only with 2 streams, not more parameters. !!!!!
- `Optional.orElseThrow()`
- check if there is more than one terminal operation
- Names: Source / Intermediate operation / Terminal operation. ~~Not Origin~~ !
- Mind `forEach(System.out::println)`; not ~~forEach(System.out.println);~~
- check if the stream ends with an Optional
- `parallelStream()` is defined on Collection, ~~NOT on Stream~~
### IntStream
- IntStream.sum() returns an int (not a long)

## Lambda
- `var x = ()->"hello"` does not compile! - **you cannot assign a lambda to a var**
- check the right symbol! it's -> NOT =>
- check lambda does not throw a Checked exception
- mind the semicolon when you assign a variable lambda.
    Example: Predicate<String> predicate = s->true;
- when using curly brackets, check if there is return!
## FunctionalInterface
- `IntUnaryOperator` is not with generics. So this does not compile: `IntUnaryOperator<String>`


## Various
- check if a field is final in the code
- `enum`: check if the constructor is private, or protected!
- `instanceof` : a class can always be an instance of an Interface, so the instanceof in that case is allowed. !!!!
- mind the scope of variables in the `instanceof`
- variable names: `_` can be allowed but not as a char single: `var _` does not compile
- multilines: check if a variable hasn't been used previously
- mind the curley brackets in the do/while 
- Local variable type inference requires a value so that the type can be inferred. `var x;`  //does not compile
- Arrays Sort String (natural order)
     1. Numbers
     2. Uppercase
     3. Lowercase
- local variables need to be initialized before being used!!
- Do NOT confuse local with instance variables when they have the same name!


## Class Design
- an instance variable final either is initialized in the constructor or in the code
- in the setX() check there is this.x=x
## check
- `switch` expression: You CANNOT use `return` but you can use `yield`.
- you need the `case` within a `switch` !!!
## Collection
- `Deque.offer()` insert element at the end of the queue
- Comparator: `comparing(...).thenComparing()`
- pop()/poll() when Deque is empty: `pop() throws java.util.NoSuchElementException` but `poll()` returns null

## Interfaces
- default method: `Plant.super.leaves()` NOT ~~super.Plant.leaves()~~
## Classes
- if there is an abstract method  makes sure the class is declared `abstract`.!!!!
### Nested Classes
- A local class can access only **final** and **effectively final** local variables
- anonymous class needs to have **semicolon** at the end.!!!!!!!!!!!
- MIND THE SEMICOLON!!! `;`
## Exception
- Check if the variable for the exception, **e**, is not already defined!!!
- check that main throws the checked exception declared in the method, 
especially with the AutoClosable resources
- in the try-with-resources check round parenthesis is used, not curly.
- try with resources: check in the variable is in scope

## JDBC
- ResultSet rs: `rs.next()` NOT ~~rs.hasNext()~~
- `ResultSet.getInt(1)` NOT ~~ResultSet.getInteger(1)~~
- watch out the overlap of `conn.savepoint()` and `conn.rollback()`
- PreparedStatement will use the existing/previous parameter set if you donâ€™t replace it.
- watch out! c`onn.prepareCall(sql)` returns a `CallableStatement` !

## Serialization
- always check the class implements `Serializable`
## java.time
- only `ZonedDateTime` has the `toInstant()` method!!
- You cannot add Duration to LocalDate
- Instant: you can only add days or smaller, otherwise you have exception
